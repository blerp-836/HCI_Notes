# Lesson 16

In this lesson we will look into needfinding a.k.a requirement finding:

1. Defining questions about the user
2. Generating answers about the user
3. Formalizing models of the user

## Data Inventory

Before doing need-finding there is a list of questions which are useful to keep in mind:
- Ultimately we want to answer

1. Who are the users?
2. Where are the users?
3. What is the context of the task?
4. What are their goals?
5. What do they need?
6. What are their tasks?
7. What are their subtasks?

## The Problem Space

We also need to identify the problem space:

1. Where is the task occurring?
2. What else is going on?
3. What are the user's explicit and implicit needs?

- Understand scope of the space

## User Types

- As we consider the problem space we also should get an idea of the space of the user i.e., we want to understand who we are designing for.
- Find full range of users
	- Kid vs Adults
	- Experts vs Novices
	- Exercising Experts vs Novices


## Avoiding Bias In Need-finding

Below are five tips in avoiding bias during need-finding:

1. Confirmation bias - We see what we want to see. Test empirically, keep samples covered
2. Observer bias - subconciouslusly bias the users. Make questions in interviews
3. Social desirability bias - Dont make people happy. Make naturalistic observations.
4. Voluntary response bias - Oversampling. Reduce survey shown
5. Recall bias - People arent good what they did during activity done in past

## Context of Task
In simple terms, the context of the task in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) refers to the situation or environment in which people interact with a computer or technology. It includes things like where the interaction is happening, what the person is trying to do, and any factors that might affect the interaction. For example, the context could be using a smartphone app to search for and book a hotel room while on vacation. Understanding the context helps designers create user-friendly and effective technology that fits people's needs and makes their interactions easier and more enjoyable.

## Context of Task (in depth)
In-depth, the context of the task in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) refers to the broader framework within which an interaction between humans and computers takes place. It encompasses various elements that influence the design, usage, and effectiveness of interactive systems. Understanding the context is crucial for creating user-centered designs and improving the overall user experience.

The context involves several key aspects:

1. Physical Environment: This includes the physical setting in which the interaction occurs. Factors such as lighting, noise, temperature, and ergonomics can impact how users engage with technology. For example, using a mobile app in a crowded, noisy environment might require a design that emphasizes clear visuals and intuitive gestures.

2. Social Environment: The social context considers the presence and influence of others during the interaction. Social factors, such as social norms, cultural expectations, and collaborative or competitive dynamics, can shape how people use technology. For instance, social media platforms need to consider the social context in which users share information and interact with others.

3. User Characteristics: Users have unique characteristics, including their knowledge, skills, preferences, and goals. Understanding users' background and capabilities helps tailor technology to their needs. Designers need to consider factors like age, education level, previous experience with technology, and any disabilities or impairments that users may have.

4. Task Characteristics: The specific goals, activities, and requirements of the task at hand influence the design of interactive systems. Factors such as the complexity of the task, the frequency of use, and the importance of accuracy or efficiency play a role in shaping the user interface and interaction design.

5. Technological Constraints: The capabilities and limitations of the underlying technology must be taken into account. Factors such as processing power, screen size, input/output mechanisms, and connectivity affect the design and usability of the system.

6. Temporal Factors: The temporal context considers the timing and duration of the interaction. Factors like user goals, time constraints, interruptions, and the sequential nature of tasks impact how users engage with technology. For example, a time-critical task may require a streamlined interface to expedite user actions.

By understanding the context, HCI designers can create interfaces that are intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable for users. Design decisions are influenced by factors such as the physical and social environment, user characteristics, task requirements, technological constraints, and temporal considerations. Taking these contextual factors into account leads to designs that better meet users' needs, expectations, and preferences.
## Naturalistic Observation

Understand the problem space and ask people later on.

Below are five tips to use during observation:

1. Take notes - Gather targeted information and observation.
2. Start specific, then abstract - Risk Tunnel vision
3. Spread out your sessions
4. Find a partner - Take notes and compare with partners
5. Look for questions - Should inform questions what you need during targeted needfinding


## Hacks And Workarounds

- No need direct interaction, just get inside their head.
	- How to accomplish a task using some shortcut.
	- Hack around using computer limitation
		- Why they using them
		- Different design challenge
			- identify errors

- **Hacks** - are ways users get around the interface to accomplish their tasks
- **Errors** - slips or mistakes that users frequently make while performing the task within the interface

## Interviews

Five quick tips for conducting effective interviews:

1. Focus on the six W's (who, what, when, where, why, and how)
	- Avoid yes and no
	- use openended and semiphrases questions
2. Be aware of bias
3. Listen
4. Organize the interview
	- Intro
	- Light questions
	- Summary
5. Practice
	- Practice in research partners

## Think Aloud
- Think louder in context of task
- Post Event Protocol
		- get information immediately after activity

## Surveys

- Get large data in quick time
	- Decide what to ask during interviews

Here are five tips for designing an effective survey:

1. Less is more - affects response rate and reliabiity
2. Be aware of bias - Look at how you are phrasing questions
3. Tie them to the inventory - Start with goals and write qeustions and connect it
4. Test it out - test using coworkers.
5. Iterate - Revise and test

## Writing Good Survey Questions

How do we write good survey questions?

1. Be clear 
	- Make sure what you are asking
	- Dont ask overlapping range
	- Give extra detail
	- Time box frequency based questions
2. Be concise
	- Ask in plain language
	- Consise vs clear is a tradeoff
3. Be specific
	- Avoid questions on super big ideas
	- Double barrel question --> avoid them
4. Be expressive
	- Emphasize users opinions
	- User ranges instead of yes/no questions
	- Give levels of frequency or agreement
	- Allow users to add nominal categories
		- FB vs Snapchat vs Others
5. Be unbiased
	- Leave open ended question open
	- Avoid loaded questions (wasted vs spent)
6. Be usable
	- Provide progress bar
	- Page length consistency
	- Order your questions logically with a flow
	- Alert users about unanswered questions
	- Preview survey yourself.
- Ask for feedback before sending

## Other approaches for data gathering
- Critique Existing UI
- See user reviews to find what users think
- Use variety of methods to get complete picture of users task


## Pros and Cons of Needfinding methods
See video 21

## Interative Needfinding
- We can use many approaches during iterative needfinding cycle.

## Revisiting Inventory
- After getting enormous amount of data, revisit inventory of things what we wanted to gather based on following questions

1. Who are the users?
2. Where are the users?
3. What is the context of the task?
4. What are their goals?
5. What do they need?
6. What are their tasks?
7. What are their subtasks?

## Representing need
- Create representation for need
	- Task outline
	- Hierarchical network graph
	- Structural relationship between components
	- Flow chart with decisions
- Similar to task analysis
	- Data gathered can summarize task analysis


## Defining The Requirements

The final step for need-finding is to define our requirements. These are the requirements that the interface must meet. They should be specific and capable of being evaluated.
	- Requirements can include components outside task
	- User related tasks
		- Functionality, Usability, Learning, Accessiblity.
		- Compatability, Compliance, Cost.

## Conclusions

Need-finding is how you develop your understanding of the needs of your user. We have discussed many different approaches from low-intervention to high-intervention:

Low-intervention need-finding:

- Naturalistic observation
- Participant observation

Mid-intervention need-finding:

- Errors and hacks
- Surveys, interviews, and focus groups

High-intervention need-finding:

- Ethnography
